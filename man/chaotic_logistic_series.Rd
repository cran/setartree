\title{Chaotic logistic map example time series}
\format{
A list containing 20 numerical vectors.
}
\description{
A list of 20 time series constructed by using the Chaotic Logistic Map (May, 1976) data generation process.
This is a part of a simulated dataset used in Hewamalage et al.(2021).
These series can be used to train the SETAR-Tree and SETAR-Forest models.
